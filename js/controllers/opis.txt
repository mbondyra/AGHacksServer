## Inspiration

We all played Counter-Strike and we wanted to make it more real and also contribute to it.

## What it does

It creates a game for 3-5 players. One of them is responsible to plant mobile expolsives. The rest, one leader and CT, must defuse the main bomb (Raspberry-PI) and also mobile explosives (Estimote Beacons). The game ends when either the time runs out or the secret code is entered.

## How I built it

We used Raspberry-PI as a Node.js server which represents GameServer. It uses express.js framework to create REST API. The "leader" uses a webpage built with AngularJS to solve puzzles and manage game. "CT" use their Android phones and our app to find Estimote Beacons and solve a puzzle to disarm it, but first they must play a hot&cold game in order to localize them.

## Challenges I ran into

Time synchronization, Android - Web compatibility and many other problems.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We have created a Simon Says game as one of the puzzles both on Anroid and Web :)

## What I learned

A lot! How to run python scripts in Node.js server, how to connect to REST API from Android and use a timeout callback to present data.

## What's next for Pi Hard

Raspberry-PI give us possibility to connect unlimited set of devices to make even more fun. We can add beacons to play with more people or challenge each other.
